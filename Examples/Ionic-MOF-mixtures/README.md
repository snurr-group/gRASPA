This folder contains an example of ternary gas mixture (CO2/N2/H2O) adsorption in an ionic MOF. This example will show you how to handle extra-framework ions in GCMC simulations. This example was taken from the published work entitled ["Predicting Partial Atomic Charges in Metal–Organic Frameworks: An Extension to Ionic MOFs"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c04879). We thank Dr. Thang D. Pham for providing these example simulation input files.
